        Nowadays most people are turning to IT when it comes to starting a business. 
        Almost everything that used to be done on paper can now be done electronically, 
        making running a business efficient and up to date. With most communication 
        being done online . it makes contacting employees, customers, suppliers and 
        stakeholders easier with all communication being done on one page or assigning
        each to a different app or method. As I said before due to most information 
        being held online (payments, employee details, stock, ect..) its allows business
        to store confidential information in a safe place being protected by cyber
        security, instead of having paper records that can easily be destroyed,
        lost or stolen.

    <h2>
        When Creating A Digital Projects What's Needed For It To Be Successfull?
    </h2>
    <p class="text2">
        Before you start creating your project, the best thing to do is planning. Drawing a layout, 
        creating a to do list, making a timetable to limit time to specific area, figuring out what  
        software you're going to use. All of these are great places to start a project, they will 
        save time in the long run and may make the process easier. Tools like Trello are excellent 
        for planning and tracking progress during the whole project. If team work is involved 
        communication is also key, so apps like Slack are a major part, allowing you to communicate 
        share links, images and files to individuals or a full team. As well as tools and planning
        skills also play a part in a project; do you have a good understanding of the software you're 
        going to use? Do you have the time management to finish the project with in an allotted timeframe?
        Organisation will also help, if you have parts of the project jumbled about it'll make it harder
        to go back and make changes when needed, and also make it easier for others. In conclusion I'd
        say that having the right planning, tools and skills will make creating a project successful.

        Planning & Carrying Out Tasks In IT.
    </h2>
    <p class="text3">
        Before I began creating my blog, I started my creating a Trello board (Link Below Text),
        outlining what needed to be done in general and giving me a basic understanding of what 
        needed to be done before writing any code. Secondly, I drew a ruff layout of each page 
        onto pager so I had an image in my head of what I wanted each to look like and could refer
        back if I ever got stuck or didn’t know what I wanted to do. For me choosing what software 
        to use was easy, Visual Studio Code was what I learned to write HTML and CSS code so it made
        sense to me to create the blog in a software that I had an understanding of.

    <h2>
        What Causes Digital Projects To Fail?
    </h2>
    <p class="text4">
        When creating a digital project, there are many components that may affect it. Without proper
        planning the project could be doomed from the start, without idea of what you’re going to do
        or when you’re going to do something.  Not having a understanding of the software or the code 
        will also affect it, if you was to constantly have to spend time on how the software works or 
        basic parts of the code it’ll take up a majority of the time you could spend doing more difficult
        tasks that could make the project better. The correct software is also essential, if you was to
        use one that isn’t recommended you would just me making the task harder for yourself and could
        make you want to quit. If teamwork is involved, the breakdown of communication will damage 
        the project significantly, two members could be working on the same thing, when they could have
        been doing separate tasks, or somebody may not pull there weight within the group which will
        affect the deadline if there was one. Other things may include: flawed ideas, unrealistic
        deadlines and lack of focus. Personally I found time management the most likely to cause my
        project to fail, spending too much time trying to figure out why something didn’t work or 
        getting something to work instead of moving on and using my time more efficiently.

    <h2>
        Selecting and using IT systems and software
    </h2>
    <p class="text5">
        Firstly, before selecting and using IT systems and software, research is needed. What
        computer/laptop you're planning to use, what software and systems you're create the
        project in, what specific needs you need to consider when choosing each of these things. 
        This may be simple if you have already created a similar project so you could choose your 
        preferred systems and sofware that works best for you. Or is you're using a language new to 
        you, find which software is most recommended and try a few out before you begin. When it 
        came to creating my project, I used a MacBook Pro 2017 that has intel core i5 and also 8GB. 
        I believe that the Mac is the most efficient for this project just to its ability's. When 
        I came to finding a software to use, I choose Visual Studio Code due to this being what I 
        learn to write HTML, CSS and JS. It's the most comfortable software for me due to having 
        experience with it and knowing the layout and its ability's. With me already knowing VSC I 
        already knew how to overcome a few of the problems I faced and was also able to learn a lot 
        of know new ways to solve them.

    <h2>
        How You Chosen Technologies Will Help you achieve your outcomes.
    </h2>
    <p class="text6">
        Throughout the development of my project Visual Studio Code, Trello and 
        GitHub have all contributed to achieving my outcomes. While writing my 
        HTML and CSS, VSC has a handy drop box when trying that completes the rest
        of the code for you, this saves time and makes the writes simpler. It also
        allows you to copy and paste, due to pages having a similar layout and 
        same font, I was able to duplicate the code easily onto each page the 
        layout and style without having to repeat code that I had already typed 
        out. Trello was a huge help in planning and development as I have 
        previously stated. Being able to track my progress it kept me on track 
        throughout. I was able to go back and use the checklist I had already 
        created that had all the tasks I had completed and needed to complete 
        in one place. You are also able to store images and documents, so having 
        everything on one page make organisation simple and easy. I used GitHub 
        to link my Visual Studio Code to, making my code accessible from any 
        computer that can access the GitHub website. There storage was also great, 
        if somehow my code got lost GitHub would be able to restore what was lost 
        as long as I updated it when I uploaded my most recent work.

    <h2>
        Legal Guidelines And Constraints That Impact Digital Projects.
    </h2> 
    <p class="text7">
        GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), is a law in the EU that business within the 
        EU have to adhere by. This means that all business have to ensure that all personal information
        and data is stored securely by encryption so no private data is leaked. It'd be aginst the law
        to store data unsecurly so all business that want to sucseed need to follow these guidelines
        very closley. They enforce this law, by handing out fines to anybody who goes against them, or 
        taking a percent of their profits. A leak of personal information from a massive organisation
        would be disasterous for them, not only would they lose a lot of money, but they would lose the
        trust of whoever uses their site, people might not enter details again if they think they're
        going to be leaked again. If somebody suspects a business of misuse of personal information
        they can ask them to remove their data and the business is require to do this. Not only is 
        GDPR inportant for business, but for users or customers, their saftey should always come first 
        and never be used for malicious intent.
