                Hey there, I'm Estelle and I am 20 years old. A student at Code Nation and coding enthusiast from Manchester. 
                I have been interested in websites and gaming from a young age, spending a lot of time on both, wondering how 
                these things worked behind the scenes. Thanks to Code Nation giving me the opportunity to study with them I am
                 now finally doing just that, and loving every second doing it. When I’m not spending my time revising or 
                 writing random codes, you’ll find me curled up in a blanket reading YA fantasy, or re-watching Game of Thrones.

    <h2>
        Why Choose Code Nation
    </h2>
    <p class="mytext2">
        In my opinion Code Nation is the best place to learn coding. If you're a beginner or already have know some code, the
        courses are suited to all levels. With such a friendly and chilled atmospere you will fit in easily and get to know a lot
        of people. After just two weeks on the develop coding course I have such a taste for coding that I don't want to leave, I 
        just want to keep learning more and more. If you've never used a mac book before the instructors are more that willing to go
        through everything will you until you're at a comfortable level. In conclusion Code Nation is a brilliant place for people 
        to learn how to code, and when you finish you'll be wanting more.
